Modern day biometric identification systems find physical or behavioral traits that can uniquely
recognize individuals. Biometrics are considered to be the highest tier of security and are used
in sensitive top secret clearance applications. Given that these biological markers (such as
fingerprints, voice, and iris topology) are considered the gold standard, consumers increasingly
rely on them to access their phones, bank accounts, and workspaces. Despite being used in
higher security applications, biometric authentication also portends its own risks as digital
recording and replication features continue to advance.
Biometric security is not infallible, and once comprised, is significantly harder to mend than
resetting a password.

This provocation brings awareness to the fact that current technology
can already nullify biometric-based security and aid identity theft, so citizens should be
proactive in preventing them from being stolen.
A second provocation goal is to prompt discussion around the dystopian not-too-distant future
we project in which the use of identity armors has been normalized. We open a space for discussing the impact this has on social interactions, dissecting the tensions
between vulnerability and privacy/safety.
